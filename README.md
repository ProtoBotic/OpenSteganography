Steganography is the act of hiding data or files within other, harmless-looking data or files. Instead of encrypting the content to make it unreadable, steganography hides the existence of the message itself. It's like hiding a secret note inside an ordinary-looking letter so that only the intended recipient knows where to look and how to decode it.

The program i created is an attempt at making Steganography more assesible to the average person by making the program more straight forward and easyer to use than other steganography programs.

My program has/can:

-A Simple User Interface

-Drag-and-drop functionality

-View Previews of most common file types

-Encode ANY file type into images (not many other steganography programs allow this for some reason)

-Allow the user to Password Protect their data using various Encryption types before encoding it into images



Features i intend to add eventaully...

-Allow encoding into audio files (audio steganography)

-Support more encryption types

-Support more file types for previewing


If you has any suggestions on what to add, Please let me know.
